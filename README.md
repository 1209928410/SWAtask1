# SWAtask1
A service about data transmission.

We want to creat a service which users can upload and download files from the server.

The transmission of WebService depends on the HTTP protocol and uses the XML format to transmit data through the SOAP protocol.Access the WSDL file via URL After the success of the service, we directly enter the browse人， and we will use this to enter the qqzone^^,  to get the WSDL file of the registry, Use the wsimport command in CMD and  to automatic generation of client code
